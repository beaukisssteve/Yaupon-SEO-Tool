1) CopyTool -  Simple Copy tool to duplicate files while adding an attribute into the filename (i.e. given 100 products, each product has 10 colors, that would be 1000 color swatches.  This app will take the template files and create unique file names for each of the pictures, while copying the 10 colors 100 times.)
